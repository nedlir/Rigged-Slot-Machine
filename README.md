# Rigged Casino Machine

### Overview
A rigged casino machine implemented using the MERN stack.

### Technologies Used

I decided to go with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express framework, React and NodeJS) stack since I recently started learning working with it as part of the [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about/) course offered by the University of Helsinki.

### Structure

I will be dividing the project into 2 main directories - client and server.

### Development Process
0. 

1. Created a client and server that communicate with each other. 
*For the server, I chose Express because it simplifies error handling and provides a better abstraction and has a simple more readable API.

*For the client, I chose axios for similar reasons of choosing Express and [This article](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/why-you-want-react-query) made me go for react-query to make the code even more abstract and to avoid using 'useEffect' code which adds a lot of "sphagetti" to the code and makes it less readable.
